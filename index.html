            <h2>Why Banana for Scale?</h2>
            <p>
                Everyone knows the size of the banana. No more arguing over meters or feet. 
                Who knows what twelve inches looks like, anyway? By communicating in terms of banana, 
                we can bridge the barrier or world-wide conversion units and use the only, true, universal unit. 
                Whether describing weight or length, the eiffel tower or your living room tv, bananas are the 
                common measurement we can all rely on.

                    Bananas have been used for scales throughout history*. If we're going to start using these 
                    fruits for our measurements, we have to understand where the unit came from. View a gallery 
                    of important, historical uses of banana for scale and learn the background behind this 
                    important figure.
